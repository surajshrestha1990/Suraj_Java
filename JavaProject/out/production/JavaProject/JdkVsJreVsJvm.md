# JDK vs JRE vs JVM vs JIT

| **Key Point**           | **JDK (Java Development Kit)**                               | **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**                          | **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**                                  | **JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)**                                      |

| **Definition**           | A software development kit used to develop Java applications. | Provides libraries, Java runtime environment, and other tools to run Java applications. | A virtual machine that runs Java bytecode and enables Java applications to run on different platforms. | A component of the JVM that compiles bytecode to native machine code for faster execution. |
| **Purpose**              | To develop, compile, and run Java programs.                  | To provide the necessary environment to run Java applications. | To execute the Java bytecode and manage memory.                  | To improve performance by compiling bytecode to machine code at runtime. |
| **Components**           | Includes JRE, compilers, debuggers, and other development tools. | Includes JVM and libraries needed to run Java applications. | The engine that executes Java bytecode.                          | Part of the JVM responsible for compiling bytecode into machine code. |
| **Includes**             | - JRE <br> - Compiler <br> - Debugger <br> - Tools            | - JVM <br> - Core libraries for runtime execution           | - Bytecode interpreter <br> - Garbage collector                 | - JVM component that compiles bytecode at runtime                      |
| **Used By**              | Java developers to create Java applications.                 | End-users to run Java programs.                              | Runs Java programs (part of JRE).                                | Optimizes performance of Java applications at runtime.                 |
| **Installation**         | Must be installed by developers to develop Java programs.    | Can be installed by end-users to run Java applications.      | Part of JRE, no separate installation required.                   | Part of the JVM, automatically invoked when needed.                    |
| **Example Tools**        | javac (Java compiler), javadoc (documentation generator)     | java (Java interpreter), libraries, and runtime files        | JVM executes bytecode from `.class` files                        | JIT compiler optimizes bytecode for performance at runtime            |
| **Platform**             | Platform-specific, depending on the OS and architecture.     | Platform-specific, depending on the OS and architecture.     | Platform-specific (dependent on the operating system).           | Platform-specific (part of JVM for each OS).                          |
| **Memory Management**    | JDK itself doesn't directly manage memory. It includes tools to help developers. | JRE, with JVM, manages memory during program execution (garbage collection). | Manages heap and stack memory during execution.                  | Affects memory management by optimizing bytecode for better performance. |

### **Summary**:
- **JDK**: A comprehensive package for Java developers, including tools like compilers and debuggers for developing Java applications.
- **JRE**: Provides the necessary environment to run Java applications but does not include development tools.
- **JVM**: Executes Java bytecode and enables Java's platform independence.
- **JIT**: A component of the JVM that compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime to improve performance.
